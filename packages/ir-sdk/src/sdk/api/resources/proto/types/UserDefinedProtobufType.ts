 * `go_package` setting:
 *
 * ```go
 * import "github.com/acme/acme-go/proto"
 *
 * type GetUserRequest struct {
 *   Username string
 *   Email    string

 * func (u *GetUserRequest) ToProto() *proto.GetUserRequest {

 *   }
 *   return &proto.GetUserRequest{
 *     Username u.Username,
 *     Email:   u.Email,
 *   }
