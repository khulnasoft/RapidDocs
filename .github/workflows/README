## Publish and Register New Generator Versions

> NOTE: all generators starting with `publish-generator-*` are publish and register workflows

These github actions are all the same, except they publish a specific generator.

They are independent in order to reflect more explicitly within the Github Actions UI which generator is being released and when.

To add new generators copy any of the files, update it's name and update the references to the previous generator to your new generator.
