description: An overview of the file and folder structure of a Rapiddocs Docs project
---

This page provides an overview of the file and folder structure of a Rapiddocs Docs project. The following structure is recommended for organizing your documentation content, but is customizable to fit your needs.

## Top-level folders 

<CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/">
```bash
  rapiddocs
  ├─ pages
  ├─ assets
  ├─ docs.yml
  ├─ openapi
  └─ rapiddocs.config.json
```
</CodeBlock>

A Rapiddocs Docs project has the following top-level folders:

- `pages`: Contains the Markdown (MDX) files that make up your documentation.
- `assets`: Contains any images or videos used in your documentation.
- `docs.yml`: The configuration file that defines the navigation, theme, and hosting details of your documentation.
- `openapi`: Contains the OpenAPI Specification file (if you have an API Reference section in your documentation).
- `rapiddocs.config.json`: The configuration file specifying your organization name and CLI version.

## Pages folder

The `pages` folder contains the Markdown (MDX) files that make up your documentation. Each MDX file represents a page in your documentation.

<CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/pages">
```bash
  pages
  ├─ introduction
  │  ├─ quickstart.mdx
  │  ├─ project-structure.mdx
  │  └─ showcase.mdx
  ├─ building-your-docs
  │  ├─ navigation
  │     ├─ sections.mdx
  │     ├─ tabs.mdx
  │     └─ versions.mdx
  └─ └─ configuration.mdx

```
</CodeBlock>

The `pages` folder is organized into subfolders based on the sections of your documentation. Each subfolder contains the MDX files for the pages in that section.

## Assets folder

The `assets` folder contains any images or videos used in your documentation. You can reference these assets in your MDX files using relative paths.

<CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/assets">
```bash
  assets
  ├─ favicon.ico
  ├─ product-screenshot.svg
  ├─ demo-video.mp4
  ├─ logo-dark-mode.png
  └─ logo-light-mode.png
```
</CodeBlock>

## `docs.yml`

The `docs.yml` file is the configuration file that defines the navigation, theme, and hosting details of your documentation. You can customize the appearance and behavior of your documentation by editing this file.

<CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/docs.yml of this website">
```yml

## API Definitions 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenAPI">
    The `openapi` folder contains the OpenAPI Specification file for your API Reference section. Rapiddocs will read either a YAML or JSON file from this folder to generate the API Reference documentation. If you don't have an API Reference section, you can skip this folder.
    <CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/openapi">
    ```bash
    openapi
    └─ openapi.yaml # OR openapi.json
    ```
    </CodeBlock>

    To see what this looks like in practice, check out [Fluidstack's Rapiddocs configuration](https://github.com/fluidstackio/rapiddocs-config/tree/main/rapiddocs/openapi).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rapiddocs Definition">
    The `definition` folder contains the Rapiddocs Definition YAML files used to generate the API Reference section. If you don't have an API Reference section, you can skip this folder.
    <CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/definition">
    ```bash
    definition
    ├─ pets.yaml
    ├─ owners.yaml
    ├─ stores.yaml
    └─ api.yaml
    ```
    </CodeBlock>

    To see what this looks like in practice, check out [Cartesia's Rapiddocs configuration](https://github.com/cartesia-ai/docs/tree/main/rapiddocs/definition).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple APIs">
    If you have multiple APIs, you can organize them into separate folders within the `apis` folder. Each API should have its own API definition. For example:
    <CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/apis">
    ```bash
    apis
    ├─ admin
    │  └─ openapi.json 
    ├─ user
    │  └─ openapi.yaml
    ```
    </CodeBlock>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## `rapiddocs.config.json`

The `rapiddocs.config.json` file specifies your organization name and the version of the Rapiddocs CLI used to generate the documentation. You can customize this file to reflect your organization's details.

<CodeBlock title="rapiddocs/rapiddocs.config.json">
```json
{
  "organization": "my-organization",
  "version": "0.55.1"
}
```
</CodeBlock>
