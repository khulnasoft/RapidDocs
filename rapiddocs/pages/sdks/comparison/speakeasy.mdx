excerpt: How do Rapiddocs and Speakeasy differ?
---

[Speakeasy](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/), similar to Rapiddocs, supports generating SDKs for APIs in multiple languages. Below, we
walk through the different capabilities of Rapiddocs and Speakeasy.

### 1. Rapiddocs is an all-in-one: SDKs + Docs

If you choose Speakeasy, you can integrate with third-party documentation providers or use its native Scalar integration. With Rapiddocs, you'll be able to generate SDKs and 
Docs with embedded code snippets.

### 2. Rapiddocs SDKs are more widely consumed.

Rapiddocs's SDKs are battle-tested and have been downloaded millions of times.

| Language   | Rapiddocs                                                                                             | Speakeasy                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript | **120k** weekly downloads ([Cohere](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cohere-ai))                     | **85k** weekly downloads ([Mistral AI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mistralai/mistralai))  |
| Python     | **6 million** lifetime downloads ([ElevenLabs](https://pepy.tech/projects/ElevenLabs)) | **17 million** lifetime downloads ([Unstructured](https://pepy.tech/projects/unstructured-client)) |

### 3. Rapiddocs offers more Generally Available SDK languages.

| Language   | Rapiddocs | Speakeasy  |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
| TypeScript | ✅   | ✅         |
| Python     | ✅   | ✅         |
| Java       | ✅   | ✅         |
| Go         | ✅   | ✅         |
| C#         | ✅   | ✅         |
| PHP        | ✅   | ✅         |
| Terraform  | ❌   | ✅         |
| Ruby       | ✅   | ❌ (Alpha) |
| Unity      | ❌   | ❌ (Beta)  |


### 4. Speakeasy generates Terraform providers.

Speakeasy supports generating Terraform Providers from your OpenAPI Specification. In order to generate the terraform provider, a user must annotate their OpenAPI with several
[extensions](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/terraform-extensions). 

### 5. Rapiddocs SDKs come with generated tests.

Rapiddocs handles generating unit tests and integration tests that run against a mock server. Every SDK method is tested and publishing
is blocked if any failures are encountered.

On the other hand, Speakeasy supports contract testing, server mocking, and API sequence testing to streamline development workflows. ([example](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/testing)).

### 6. Rapiddocs supports OAuth + DPoP.

| Feature                    | Rapiddocs | Speakeasy  |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| `Bearer`                   | ✅   | ✅         |
| `Basic`                    | ✅   | ✅         |
| Custom Headers             | ✅   | ✅         |
| `OAuth` Client Credentials | ✅   | ✅         |
| `OAuth` Refresh            | ✅   | ✅         |
| DPop (Proof of possession) | ✅   | ❌         |

### 7. Rapiddocs's file structure is resource based.

Rapiddocs's SDKs are organized so that developers can easily find their way around your API.

### 8. Speakeasy offers a management dashboard.

Speakeasy offers a management dashboard where you can visualize each SDK and understand the release process. On the
contrary, Rapiddocs is primarily GitHub + CLI focused.

### 9. Rapiddocs SDK methods support configuring timeouts, retries, auth, etc.

Rapiddocs's `RequestOptions` are documented and make it easy for developers to control retries, auth, abort, and timeout
behavior.

| Feature          | Rapiddocs | Speakeasy |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Auth Override    | ✅   | ✅        |
| Timeout Override | ✅   | ✅        |
| Retry Override   | ✅   | ✅        |
