 * Defines the information related to a Protobuf service declaration. This is
 * primarily meant to be used to instantiate the internal gRPC client used by
 * the SDK.
 *
 * For example, consider the following C# snippet which instantiates a
 * `UserService` gRPC client:
 *
 * ```csharp
 * using User.Grpc;
 *
 * public class RawGrpcClient
 * {
 *     public UserService.UserServiceClient UserServiceClient;
 *
 *     public RawGrpcClient(...)
 *     {
 *         GrpcChannel channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(...);
 *         UserServiceClient = new UserService.UserServiceClient(channel);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
