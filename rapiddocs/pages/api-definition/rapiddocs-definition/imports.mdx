title: Imports in Rapiddocs Definition 
description: Use imports to reference API types and errors from other Rapiddocs Definition files.
---

Imports allow you to reference types and errors from other files.

```yaml title="person.yml"
types:
  Person: ...
```

```yaml title="family.yml"
imports:
  person: ./path/to/person.yml
types:
  Family:
    properties:
      people: list<person.Person> # use an imported type
```

Note that you can only import files that exist in your Rapiddocs Definition (i.e., in the same `definition/` folder).
