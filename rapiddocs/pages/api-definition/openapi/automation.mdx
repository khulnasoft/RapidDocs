title: Automatically Update
subtitle: Pull your latest OpenAPI Specification into your Rapiddocs Folder automatically.
---

If you host your OpenAPI Specification at a publically available URL, you can have Rapiddocs programmatically fetch the latest spec on a preconfigured cadence. By default, this will be done every day and open a new PR on the GitHub repo that contains your Rapiddocs Folder. This feature requires installation of the [Rapiddocs GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/khulnasoft).
