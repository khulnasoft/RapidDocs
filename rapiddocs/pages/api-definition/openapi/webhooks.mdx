title: Define Webhooks in OpenAPI
subtitle: Use the `x-rapiddocs-webhook` extension to define webhooks in your OpenAPI spec
---

To define a webhook in your OpenAPI specification, add the `x-rapiddocs-webhook: true` extension to your endpoint. OpenAPI 3.0.0 or higher is required. Rapiddocs will treat the `requestBody` as the webhook payload. 

```yaml openapi.yml {6}
paths: 
  /payment/updated/: 
    post: 
      summary: Payment Initiated
      operationId: initiatePayment
      x-rapiddocs-webhook: true
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                amount:
                  type: number
                currency:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Currency'
              required:
                - amount
                - currency 
```

<Info> 
The path that you choose when defining a webhook can be arbitrary. Since webhooks 
can be sent to any server, Rapiddocs just ignores the path.
