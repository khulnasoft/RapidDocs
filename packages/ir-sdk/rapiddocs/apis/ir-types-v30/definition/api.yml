  Changes in this version of IR include:
  - Adds the new ExampleUnionType.
  - Adds the new EscapedString type particularly suited for string literals
    that contain characters that must be escaped (e.g. '{"foo": "bar"}').
  - Refactors path parameters, query parameters, and headers to include the
    full Name type rather than just their respective wire representations.
