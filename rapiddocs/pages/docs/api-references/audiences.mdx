subtitle: Use audiences to filter the endpoints, schemas, and properties that are displayed in your API Reference.

Audiences are a useful tool for segmenting your API for different consumers. Common examples of audiences include `public` 
and `beta`. You can configure audiences in both [the OpenAPI Specification](/learn/api-definition/openapi/audiences) as well as [the Rapiddocs Definition](/learn/api-definition/rapiddocs/audiences).

Once you've added audiences to your API Specification, you can filter to that audience by adding the `audience` property to the `api` object in your `docs.yml` navigation.

<CodeBlocks>
```yaml title="docs.yml" {3-4}
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    audiences:
      - public
```
</CodeBlocks>

Here's [an example from Schematic](https://github.com/SchematicHQ/schematic-rapiddocs-config/blob/e19f5ea69a343727ed018e79127bf4fd20ad0f7b/rapiddocs/docs.yml#L128-L129) in production.
