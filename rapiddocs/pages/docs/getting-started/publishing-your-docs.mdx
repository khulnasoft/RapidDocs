title: Publishing your docs
---

When you are ready for your docs to be publicly accessible, you can publish them using the Rapiddocs CLI. 

## Usage

```bash
rapiddocs generate --docs
```

### Example

```bash
rapiddocs generate --docs
[docs]: Found 0 errors and 1 warnings. Run rapiddocs check --warnings to print out the warnings.
[docs]: ✓ All checks passed
[docs]: Published docs to https://plantstore.docs.buildwithrapiddocs.com
┌─
│ ✓  https://plantstore.docs.buildwithrapiddocs.com
└─
```

### Usage in GitHub Actions
To automate the publishing process, you can use a GitHub Action workflow to publish your docs when a push is made to the `main` branch. [Be sure to add the `FERN_TOKEN` for your organization to the repository](/learn/cli-api/cli-reference/commands#rapiddocs-token). 

```yaml .github/workflows/publish-docs.yml
name: Publish Docs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && contains(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main') && github.run_number > 1 }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Rapiddocs
        run: npm install -g khulnasoft

      - name: Publish Docs
        env:
          FERN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FERN_TOKEN }}
        run: rapiddocs generate --docs
```

## Hosting 

When you publish your docs, Rapiddocs takes care of hosting them for you. To publish your docs to a custom domain, check out our docs [here](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/custom-domain). 

### Self-hosting your docs

<Tip>
This feature is available on the Enterprise plan. [Contact us](https://buildwithrapiddocs.com/contact) to learn more.
</Tip>

If you need access to your docs offline or would like to host your docs on your own server, Rapiddocs offers that option as well. Self-hosted docs have limited access to certain features (including search).
