Rapiddocs offers two ways to preview changes to your documentation: a [local development environment](#local-development) and [unique preview links](#generate-a-preview-link).

## Local development

Rapiddocs allows you to view changes to your documentation in a locally-hosted environment.

<Info>**Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 18 or higher) before proceeding.</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run the Rapiddocs CLI:

**Step 1**: Install the Rapiddocs CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g khulnasoft
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add khulnasoft
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `rapiddocs` folder is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
rapiddocs docs dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The functionality is available offline if you have run local development mode online at least once.

<Note>Some features (e.g. search) are disabled in the local development environment.</Note>

### Custom ports

By default, Rapiddocs uses port 3000. You can customize the port Rapiddocs runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Rapiddocs on port 3002,
use this command:

```bash
rapiddocs docs dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Rapiddocs on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

## Generate a preview link

Rapiddocs allows you to generate a shareable preview link displaying the current state of your docs. Each preview link is appended with a UUID and is not indexed. Currently, these links do not expire (this behavior is subject to change in the future).

**Usage**:

```bash
rapiddocs generate --docs --preview
```

**Example**:

```bash
rapiddocs generate --docs --preview

[docs]: Found 0 errors and 1 warnings. Run rapiddocs check --warnings to print out the warnings.
[docs]: Published docs to https://rapiddocs-preview-a1da0157-93ca-4b1f-b310-8dd34fb891ca.docs.buildwithrapiddocs.com
